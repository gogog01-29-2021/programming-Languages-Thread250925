A dynamic filter in C usually involves:

Structs to define filter state.
Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free) to manage filter data.
Runtime flexibility to change filter behavior or parameters.
  typedef struct {
    float *buffer;
    int size;
    int index;
} DynamicFilter;

DynamicFilter* create_filter(int size) {
    DynamicFilter *filter = malloc(sizeof(DynamicFilter));
    filter->buffer = calloc(size, sizeof(float));
    filter->size = size;
    filter->index = 0;
    return filter;
}
