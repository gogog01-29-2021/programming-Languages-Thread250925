give me core part and some part and key code summarization for these 500 pages that also some part that doesn't come out on here in depth knowledge such as Extension and grammar changing.


--Chapter3 syntax in functions
--Patern Matching
-- Basic pattern matching
lucky :: Int -> String
lucky 7 = "LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN!"
lucky x = "Sorry, you're out of luck, pal!"

-- Recursive patterns
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- Tuple patterns
addVectors :: (Double, Double) -> (Double, Double) -> (Double, Double)
addVectors (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)

-- List patterns
head' :: [a] -> a
head' [] = error "Can't call head on empty list"
head' (x:_) = x

-- As-patterns (keeping reference to whole)
firstLetter :: String -> String
firstLetter "" = "Empty string!"
firstLetter all@(x:xs) = "The first letter of " ++ all ++ " is " ++ [x]
